# CCC-Solutions
Solutions for problems that have appeared in the Canadian Computing Competition administrated by the University of Waterloo.

The goal is to eventually upload a solution to every problem that has appeared in the CCC.

All solutions are written in C++, although I am considering the use of Python for the Junior problems.  
The solutions can pass all test cases in the mirror contest on [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/).  
Generally, the DMOJ judge offers test cases of equal or stronger strength to those in the actual CCC contest.  
For example, all test cases on CCC 2015 S3 - [Gates](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc15s3) can be solved with a brute force O(GP) solution
in the official contest portal. However, an O(P logG) solution is required to pass all DMOJ tests without TLE.

A multi-line comment with a brief description of each solution will be at the top of every file.
